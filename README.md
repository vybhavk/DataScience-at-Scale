<b>Steps followed in Tableau for Data visualization</b></br>
1)Drag what ever the rows we need to represent in graph to the Row field.</br>
2)Drag the fields to the Column field.</br>
3) we can create filter by using some columns.

Ex:
1) Drag "Number of Records" from measures to rows.<br>
2) Drag "Hour(time)" from dimensions to columns. By default, this will be aggregated to Hour.<br>
3) we can create filter by using some columns like catagory or district column.
